Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

The website itself has three fields a Email, Name, and your date of birth. press submit to push your submission into the database. click display info button
to look at the data in the database on the right hand side of the table there are checkboxes click on them and teh cells become editable and you can deelte or edit them by selecting the checkbox and pressing the corresponding button.

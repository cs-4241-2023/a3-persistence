## Log Your Workout

The application allows users to keep records of their previous workouts including the day of the workout, what exercise was done, how many sets, reps, and the weight was lifted. During the development of this application, I had trouble converting to mongodb and storing information in the database when submitting the log. I had to restructure the data to be able to solve my issues.

I used GitHub OAuth because I felt that it would make the most sense to use this authentication strategy for this class as we are using GitHub to submit out assignments.

I chose to use Bootstrap as the CSS framework as it is commonly used and would have the most documentation for its features and how to use it. I made a few modifications to the framework such as the font. I overrided bootstrap's default font with the Oswald Google Font, and used my own color pallete for some features.

express.static() is used to serve static files to the Express app.
express.json() is used to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I got 100% in all four lighthouse tests. The screenshot is provided in the GitHub repo.

I was given an extension by the professor on this assignment.

## A3 Task Manager Application

Glitch link: https://glitch.com/~a3-camilo-cordobaescobar

Extension confirmed by Prof. Roberts.

- The goal of this application is store tasks using persistent storage and user accounts
- I had difficulties with reformatting my server functions to implement MongoDB and express functionality
- I chose local storage and MongoDB as my authentication strategy because it was the simplest. When the user enters new or saved login info, the local storage saves the username and whether the user is logged in, which is then used to get the correct data from the tasks collection.
- I used bootstrap because I wanted to work with a popular CSS framework that I'll likely use later on in my CS career
  - I modified the CSS stylesheets to implement some flex box functionalities and other colors

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implement OAuth authentication by using local storage and MondoDB.

- **Design Achievement 2**: I got 100% on each required Lighthouse test.

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-charlie-roberts.glitch.me

To log in to the application, valid user/pass combinations are: DM/DM and Player1/Player
The application is meant to be a tool to organize combatants in a tabletop rpg, where players can view essential information as the name of a creature, it's status, and it's physical representation
I used simple username and password authentication, and didn't implement any security like hashing the passwords.
I used Pico.css (https://picocss.com/) because it included light/dark mode and I liked how the dark mode looked.
Changes to the framework included positioning, putting borders around the entire table, and making the delete button red. The table is because of the number of columns, meaning vertical lines are useful. Making the Delete button stand out is important, and how more important can something be than be the only red object?

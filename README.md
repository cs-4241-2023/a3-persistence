## David's Subway Challenge Leaderboard

Self-host: http://66.189.31.92:3000/  \
If it is down for whatever reason let me know.

- Goal: I wanted there to be a central place for all the scores of the Subway Challenge (a challenge to go to all the subway stations in NYC) to be in one place
- Challenge: The session object was really hard for me to wrap my head around.
- Authentication Stategy: I give each use a token upon signing in, then I use that token to keep track of them. I did this because it was fairly simple to implement.
- CSS: I used a framework called Pure, as it keeps everything simple which is kind of what I wanted with the website.
  - I made the site dark mode because I like it, kept my CSS grid because I didn't want to remake it, and made the inputs large so I could pass the google lighthouse.
- The middleware I used was cookie-seesion for cookies and squirrelly for dynamically adding things to the webpage.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I self-hosted the website
  - Better: I get full control and can control what people can and cannot see
  - Worse: More work
- **Tech Achievement 2**: 100% in Lighthouse
  - Check Lighthouse.png in the repo for proof if it doesn't run on your machine

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- None

I know thats only 10/15 points of achievements but I'm tired.

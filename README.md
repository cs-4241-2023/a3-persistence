I created a todo list with persistent storage using Mongo. The hardest thing was figuring out how to login and make all that work. I used the local storage for authentication becuase I felt that was the easiest to do. And used a CSS called Sakura becuase I thought it looked nice and also added a modifying feature. My application also has a register button to register new accounts. I used one middle ware function which gets all the login and password and helps to store it.

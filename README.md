Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application: 
The goal of the application is to allow users to safely create and store tasks into a mongodb database
- challenges you faced in realizing the application: 
Some challenges I faced was adding the user log in and authentication method. My application is not correctly loading the login page first before taking them to the home page to add tasks

I hosted my application on vercel but for some reason when tasks are created on there they are not displayed. On localhost my tasks update and show up in the mongodb database. I am not sure what the issue is. On glitch the application does not load.
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable). I tried to implement passport.js into my application but am having issues
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does
  I added middleware for user authentication but I was not able to test it. I have passport.js installed and added to my express app

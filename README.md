the goal of this application is to allow you to create a account and access a present list. this then allows you to create a list with the type of present and the price of that specific present. each account is associated with its own present list.
some of the challenges i faced in the application were making sure that the information was accessed correctly through mongodb. I chose the passport.js functionality because i thought that it was the easiest to implement within my assignment.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement**: I used OAuth authentication with the passport.js library. I attempted to host my site on a different website, however, I had trouble starting it and figuring out so I ultimately stuck with glitch.

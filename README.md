## User Database

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. https://glitch.com/~a3-ammarrinan

This page is an application that stores users and their login credentials, as well as basci information about them such as their emolyment type, as well as the deperatmant they work in or are majoring in. The challenging goal was to make it so users can also be defiend as admins, which allows them to be used as new login credentials instead of just using the default ones. 

- The goal of the application is to allow for users to be created and edited, with admin users mixed in.
- Hardcoding login credentials was an option, but I wanted to challenge myself by letting the user add, edit, and even remove admin accounts to show how the login system is funcitonal
- I used MUI as my CSS framework because I thought it looked nice, and it seemed to provide enogugh felxability and customization to enable more than just a white/black background. Though in hindisght while I tried my best, it had less modularity than I had hoped.
  - The major modifications I made to the CSS framework were the fonts changing as well as well as the color schemes to more match the color pallete I had used for a2

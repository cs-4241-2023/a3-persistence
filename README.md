## Homework Tracker

The goal of the application is to be able to have an account and 
be able to track your homework assignments and mark them as done.
The challenges I faced were that I wasn't able to download many of
packages at first but once I was able to I was able to get more parts working
and I was also not able to add any assignments to the table. I used the water.css 
framework and I used it because I like that it has the option to be in dark mode
or light mode based on user preference and I think it looks a lot more professional than
the purple that I had before even if its more basic. For middleware I just used express-handlebars 
which allowed the app to render allowing the page to display a message like
welcome back for returners, succesfully created account, or invalid password.

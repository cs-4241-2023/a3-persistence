## TODO List App

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. 

http://a3-charlie-roberts.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application: 
The goal of the application is to allow users to safely create and store tasks into a mongodb database
- challenges you faced in realizing the application: 
Some challenges I faced was adding the user log in and authentication method. My application is not correctly loading the login page first before taking them to the home page to add tasks
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable). I tried to implement passport.js into my application but am having issues
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does
  I added middleware for user authentication but I was not able to test it. I have passport.js installed and added to my express app
